### Release Notes:

This website is made for The Visionaries,  
The Visionaries is a next-generation business incubator and venture studio for early-stage startups.  
The website is useful to facilitate the goal of the visionaries in which there are many features in it.  

**Features**
1. Home Page:  
    This page is important to introduce what The Visionaries really is and also as the first landing page from users. Then, inside there are several clickable buttons that will take users (if they are interested in the services in the business) to a page to schedule a meeting with the CEO of The Visionaries (Peter Yassopoulous).  

    A button in the Hero section is also clickable and will take users to the about us page where The Visionaries will be explained in more depth.  

    A 3D Animation is implemented as well in the hero section of this website project.  

2. Services Page:  
    This page is where users can see all the services offered by the Visionaries and in which there are sub-services page
    connected to this page and there will be a detailed version of each service offered. All services can then be enquiried by sending an inquiry to Peter (The CEO).  

3. Contact Us Page:  
    This page is connected to most pages in the website since this page is acting as a portal from the website to Peter (The CEO).

6. Podcast Page:  
    This page will be used by The Visionaries to upload their podcast which as well will be handled by the Visionaries' admin on later days. The videos of the podcast will be using YouTube links as The Visionaries will upload their podcast to their YouTube channel first then link it to the website.

9. Footer That Acts as Page Index:  
    The footer has been redesigned and all done with more modern styling.  
    
10. Join The Journey Page:  
    This page is to attract users to join The Visionaries (using their services) in which there will be also a link to a job posting page (job opportunities button). However, Peter said that this page can be handled by us later on after the semester is done if we are interested. If not, he will hand it to other IT Team in his preference.  


Footer and Join The Journey Page are inspired from a running website called Nobody Studios:

### Installation and Running Instructions:  
Running the website is easy. It can be done through the link from Github Pages provided here.  

However, the client is about to host the website on GoDaddy which is a hosting platform and it is providing domain name service as well. The domain name can be accessed when only the client has given it to us. Peter said he wanted to upload the website by himself with The Visionaries team. We as a team had offered him for us to host the website as well (we doing the process) but Peter is with the uploading by himself option. We can't proceed to the next step because this will involve buying the hosting subsription and buying the domain name which will also involve money inside it.  

Until today, the client hasn't given us the credentials to log in to GoDaddy with subscribed hosting services and domain name. Therefore, the only way to access it now is through Github Pages.
